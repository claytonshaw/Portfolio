-- Step 0 (SQL):
-- Create a database table called BookList to hold the data
-- * Field names as outlined in extraction below
-- * Add Identity, Key, Constraint columns as appropriate
-- * Provide the DDL statements used

CREATE TABLE BookList (
    BookID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    Title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    ISBN VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    NumPages INT,
    AuthorName VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Step 4 (SQL):
-- * Write a separate SQL report that will retrieve the 5 longest and 5 shortest books, with their ranking (e.g. books 1-5 and 25-30)
